Milled to perfection from our most selective Premium grade of raw materials, the exceptionally thick 4 mm wear layer and engineered construction allows for installation directly over concrete. Get all of the amazing qualities of unfinished solid flooring without the warping, cupping, and installation complexities of installing solid hardwood. With options in American White Oak, American Red Oak, American Walnut, and European Oak. Available in square edge planks in various widths, the possibilities are endless. These incredible floors are eager to be custom stained and finished to meet your needs and suit your distinct style and demands.Please note: The beauty of hardwood flooring lies in natural variations in color, grain, and texture inherent in all wood products. In addition, although we color calibrate all of our photos, colors may appear differently on different monitors and devices and flooring will vary in hue and saturation based on differing lighting conditions. Please expect variation in all flooring. We highly recommend seeing a sample board of flooring in person before making your decision, and understanding that flooring may vary slightly from these boards.

Milled to perfection from our most selective Premium grade of raw materials, the exceptionally thick 4 mm wear layer and engineered construction allows for installation directly over concrete. Get all of the amazing qualities of unfinished solid flooring without the warping, cupping, and installation complexities of installing solid hardwood. With options in American White Oak, American Red Oak, American Walnut, and European Oak. Available in square edge planks in various widths, the possibilities are endless. These incredible floors are eager to be custom stained and finished to meet your needs and suit your distinct style and demands.Please note: The beauty of hardwood flooring lies in natural variations in color, grain, and texture inherent in all wood products. In addition, although we color calibrate all of our photos, colors may appear differently on different monitors and devices and flooring will vary in hue and saturation based on differing lighting conditions. Please expect variation in all flooring. We highly recommend seeing a sample board of flooring in person before making your decision, and understanding that flooring may vary slightly from these boards. Please contact us for more information and to be connected to a sales representative who will point you in the right direction.",

With options in American White Oak, American Red Oak, American Walnut, and European Oak. Available in square edge planks in various widths, the possibilities are endless. These incredible floors are eager to be custom stained and finished to meet your needs and suit your distinct style and demands.Please note: The beauty of hardwood flooring lies in natural variations in color, grain, and texture inherent in all wood products. In addition, although we color calibrate all of our photos, colors may appear differently on different monitors and devices and flooring will vary in hue and saturation based on differing lighting conditions. Please expect variation in all flooring. We highly recommend seeing a sample board of flooring in person before making your decision, and understanding that flooring may vary slightly from these boards.

            "description": "This line of unfinished engineered flooring is a canvas for your imagination. Milled to perfection from our most selective Premium grade of raw materials, the exceptionally thick 4 mm wear layer and engineered construction allows for installation directly over concrete. Get all of the amazing qualities of unfinished solid flooring without the warping, cupping, and installation complexities of installing solid hardwood. With options in American White Oak, American Red Oak, American Walnut, and European Oak. Available in square edge planks in various widths, the possibilities are endless. These incredible floors are eager to be custom stained and finished to meet your needs and suit your distinct style and demands.Please note: The beauty of hardwood flooring lies in natural variations in color, grain, and texture inherent in all wood products. In addition, although we color calibrate all of our photos, colors may appear differently on different monitors and devices and flooring will vary in hue and saturation based on differing lighting conditions. Please expect variation in all flooring. We highly recommend seeing a sample board of flooring in person before making your decision, and understanding that flooring may vary slightly from these boards. Please contact us for more information and to be connected to a sales representative who will point you in the right direction.",

            "description": "This line of unfinished engineered flooring is a canvas for your imagination. Milled to perfection from our most selective Premium grade of raw materials, the exceptionally thick 4 mm wear layer and engineered construction allows for installation directly over concrete. Get all of the amazing qualities of unfinished solid flooring without the warping, cupping, and installation complexities of installing solid hardwood. With options in American White Oak, American Red Oak, American Walnut, and European Oak. Available in square edge planks in various widths, the possibilities are endless. These incredible floors are eager to be custom stained and finished to meet your needs and suit your distinct style and demands.Please note: The beauty of hardwood flooring lies in natural variations in color, grain, and texture inherent in all wood products. In addition, although we color calibrate all of our photos, colors may appear differently on different monitors and devices and flooring will vary in hue and saturation based on differing lighting conditions. Please expect variation in all flooring. We highly recommend seeing a sample board of flooring in person before making your decision, and understanding that flooring may vary slightly from these boards. Please contact us for more information and to be connected to a sales representative who will point you in the right direction.",

            "description": "This line of unfinished engineered flooring is a canvas for your imagination. Milled to perfection from our most selective Premium grade of raw materials, the exceptionally thick 4 mm wear layer and engineered construction allows for installation directly over concrete. Get all of the amazing qualities of unfinished solid flooring without the warping, cupping, and installation complexities of installing solid hardwood. With options in American White Oak, American Red Oak, American Walnut, and European Oak. Available in square edge planks in various widths, the possibilities are endless. These incredible floors are eager to be custom stained and finished to meet your needs and suit your distinct style and demands.Please note: The beauty of hardwood flooring lies in natural variations in color, grain, and texture inherent in all wood products. In addition, although we color calibrate all of our photos, colors may appear differently on different monitors and devices and flooring will vary in hue and saturation based on differing lighting conditions. Please expect variation in all flooring. We highly recommend seeing a sample board of flooring in person before making your decision, and understanding that flooring may vary slightly from these boards. Please contact us for more information and to be connected to a sales representative who will point you in the right direction.",
